# Share and read pdf.
Initially I wrote this to try out springboot but I kinda enjoyed it and completed a mini
file sharing system. This thing only supports uploading pdf since I personally use
pdf and firefox has amazing pdf reader. On chrome you can use
[PDF viewer for vimium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pdf-viewer-for-vimium-c/nacjakoppgmdcpemlfnfegmlhipddanj)
instead of default one to get the best experience.

To run this project
```sh
  docker-compose up -d
  ./gradlew bootrun
```
opendjk 17 was used for building this project
